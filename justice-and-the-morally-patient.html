<p> Introduction <p>
<br>
<p> Any theory of justice that fails to account for existing non-agents in its calculus cannot be adequate.
In this essay, the non-agent bodies that concern me are children and the cognitively disabled and
my target is Robert Nozick’s theory put forth in Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974).
In Section I, I will briefly summarize Nozick’s theory and explicate relevant arguments.
In Section II, I will test his theory under the weight of my thesis.
In Section III, I will discuss possible objections to my criticism. <p>
<br>
<p>Section I: Nozickian Justice<p>
<br>
	<p>Consider the following conception of human individuals: “sentient and self-conscious; rational (capable of using abstract concepts,
    not tied to responses to immediate stimuli); possessing free will; being a moral agent capable of guiding its behavior by
    moral principles and capable of engaging in mutual limitation of conduct” (Nozick, 48). An individual has “the ability to regulate
    and guide its life in accordance with some overall conception it chooses to accept” (Nozick, 49). This autonomy is what gives human
    life meaning and individuals have inviolable rights to pursue their meaning. These rights––to do things and not have things done
    to one––provide moral side constraints on any individual's actions and preserve each’s autonomy. They are inherent due to our moral
    worth as separate persons and precede any institutions. This is what it means to be an “agent.”<p>
<br>
	<p>Contrary to the anarchist’s belief, a state can still be justified when taking an agent’s rights seriously. Nonetheless, this state
  would only be the “night-watchman”: “a minimal state limited to the narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud,
  enforcement of contracts…. any more extensive state will violate a person's rights not to be forced to do things” (Nozick, xix).
  Moreover, “two noteworthy implications are that the state may not use its coercive apparatus for the purpose of getting some citizens
  to aid others, or in order to prohibit activities to people for their own good” (Nozick, xix). For the purposes of this essay, it is
  fine to assume that Nozick correctly explains how we can get from pure anarchy to the minimal state without elaborating it here. [The
  essential idea is that some individuals would realize that the cost of not paying for a private protective service would be too high
  since their autonomy is at stake, so it is rational to pay a premium for insurance. Eventually, the dominant protective service would
  serve all essential stately duties regarding protecting rights but no more. Since the night-watchman is funded privately, and not
  through taxes, some individuals would also have the choice to free-ride the benefits that patrons bring to the respective community
  (Nozick, 26-7). However, the night-watchman is only obligated to enforce the rights of patrons, so free-riders are responsible for
  their own risk.<p>
<br>
<p>In addition, if agent rights are taken seriously, then only a historical entitlement theory of justice can be yielded. The entitlement
theory of holdings (i.e. economic objects) has three principles: just acquisition, just transfer, and rectification of violations of
first two principles. Just acquisition of holdings can occur via the Lockean proviso which states that someone can initially acquire an
unclaimed holding if it does not make anyone else worse off. Just transfer occurs when A agrees to give B something and B accepts; it
is a consensual bilateral transaction. Rectification only fixes any mishaps in the first two principles. Inductively, any distribution
of holdings among individuals that occurs according to the entitlement theory is a just distribution because it respects agent rights
(Nozick, 151).<p>
<br>
<p>In contrast, end-state theories which are concerned with specific patterned distributions of holdings require a preconceived pattern.
However, no state can attempt to redistribute holdings to fit a pattern that varies from the one produced by the entitlement theory
without violating agent rights (Nozick, 155). End-state theorists argue that a distribution of holdings that stems from the morally
arbitrary distribution of natural assets (i.e. talents and upbringing) ought to be corrected. The reasoning goes: natural assets are
a matter of luck, so individuals do not deserve them or the distribution of holdings that stems from them (Nozick, 216). Instead,
distribution of holdings should depend on morally non-arbitrary reasons. However, this line of reasoning completely disregards a
person’s autonomous choices to develop their natural assets and reduces everything noteworthy about them to external factors
(Nozick, 214).<p>
<br>
<p>Let us assume that Nozick successfully argues against six versions of the end-state thesis (Nozick, 216-24). Finally, this allows
  him to formulate argument G: P1: People are entitled to (even if they do not “deserve”) their natural assets. P2: If people are
  entitled to something, then they are entitled to anything that flows from it. P3: People’s holdings flow from their natural assets.
  C1: People are entitled to their holdings (=P1+P2+P3). P4: If people are entitled to something, then they ought to have it.
  P5: This entitlement overrides any presumption of morally non-arbitrary reasons such as equality (Nozick, 225). C2: People ought
  to have their holdings (=C1+P4+P5).<p>
<br>
<p>Section II: Beyond Agents<p>
<br>
<p>Even before I develop my argument, it is clear from Nozick’s assumption of a human individual that his theory is primarily
  designed to account for agents. So, what about non-agents?
Let me clarify some concepts. “Moral status” is the quality of something that deserves regard by agents. So, agents have moral
status. Even private property has moral status derivatively, simply by virtue of association with an agent. That is why there are
certain things I can do to your backpack and other things I cannot, depending on your consent. However, children and the cognitively
disabled cannot count as agents in Nozick’s sense. They are sentient and have free will, but they are mostly irrational and incapable
of guiding their behavior according to moral principles. They are agent-esque at best––autonomous to some degree but lacking the
cognitive capacity to make rational and reasonable choices. Nonetheless, they clearly have a moral status that is not derivative
from that of other agents. For example, I cannot enslave an orphan since they have rights independent of their capacity to satisfy
the preferences of some adult agent. This should be an unsurprising claim and its application in real-world medical consent is
illuminating: important decisions have to be made on behalf of the non-agents for their wellbeing by competent and trustworthy
surrogates such as immediate family, and these must respect the non-agents’ rights. So, let us call these non-agent humans that
lack the autonomous decision-making capacity “moral patients.” A patient is defined by three characteristics: it has its own
interests, which should be respected for their own sake, and exists in a way that can be understood by other agents (Basl, 25).
Although Nozick does not deliberately consider patients, we can try to see how they would fare under his theory. Consider the
following two worries.<p>
<br>
<p>W1: “The night-watchman only protects the rights of paying members.” It would be silly to assume patients have the capacity to
know that they should be paying for their own protection. So, Nozick must be making two other assumptions here. Firstly, the agent
family members of a patient form their protective body i.e. patients are on the family insurance plan. If the family pays for the
protective service, then the patient is also protected. However, if the family does not pay, then the patient is not protected and
they have no other way to choose for themself to be protected. Thus, this assumption faces the “ignored problem.” Secondly, the
family members have the best interest of the patient in mind. This is not an unreasonable assumption considering that is what it
means to be family. However, there are serious reasons for why many countries have Child Protective Services (CPS) and related
services for vulnerable populations. Let us call them “Patient Protective Services” (PPS). In the case of the domestic “abuse
problem,” the night-watchman would be idle if the patient is uninsured. The cost of not having PPS would be too high, yet patients
cannot choose to have it on their own behalf. Nozick expects people to be kind to one another but does not think the state should
force kindness. I am not necessarily arguing against this view but rather/simply stating that his line of thought cannot treat the
abuse problem.<p>
<br>
<p>W2: “Patients have severe restrictions on gaining entitlements.” Given their limited capacity to consent, they would be unable to
acquire holdings or form contracts to alienate their labor in any way that could sufficiently support their economic livelihood.
For example, child labor is undoubtedly exploitation and the type of work cognitively disabled persons should be allowed to engage
in is also acutely limited to avoid exploitative situations. So, their options would be limited to the charity of their family and
community, in the absence of which they remain completely insecure.<p>
Moreover, according to Nozick’s argument G, patients are owed nothing more than what flows from their limited set of natural assets.
This creates an issue. In C2, Nozick writes that no non-arbitrary moral reason such as equality can justify inorganically directing
holdings towards patients from agents. Even if he is correct in asserting this for economic inequality, it is still unclear what the
implications are for unequal persons. In Nozick’s mind, well-endowed agents and less-endowed agents have the same rights and
responsibilities. However, patients cannot possibly have the same set of responsibilities as agents (albeit, it is unclear how much
rights vary). Patients clearly lie below a certain threshold of practical autonomy that makes us distinguish them with different
terminology in the first place. Hence, there is a necessary inequality that exists that Nozick does not foresee or account for in
“natural assets.” Since his theory does not accommodate this inequality, it does not respect patients as full persons. Although I
cannot offer a more elaborate theory of personhood for patients at this moment, I only want to emphasize how this issue severely
limits the entitlements of patients.<p>
<br>
<p>Section III: Objections and Responses<p>
<br>
	<p>Here I will address 5 noteworthy objections that arise sequentially in Section II.<p>
<br>
	<p>O1: “Moral patients do not make up enough of our population to have significant weight in our conception of a human individual.”
  Children and the cognitively disabled comprise 22.6% (Child Trends 2019) and 10.8% (CDC 2019) of the US population respectively,
  which is clearly not negligible. These are only two vulnerable groups among others. By excluding patients, one paints a very
  ableist picture of human society and essentially presupposes a utopia in arguing for how to get to one. Furthermore, Nozick would
  be one to agree that it does not matter what the ratio of patients to agents is––injustice occurs at the level of individuals and
  not groups (Nozick, 190). A theory of justice fails if there is even one human whose rights are not taken seriously.<p>
<br>
	<p>O2: “How is your thesis different from feminist critiques of ‘theories of justice’?” Notably, Susan Moller Okin points out that
  the exclusion of women’s issues in analytic theories of justice is problematic (Okin, 134). Without going too far into that debate,
  it should be clear that adult women, no matter how vulnerable, are autonomous moral agents (perhaps, with the union of another set
  of rights and responsibilities given their human life creating biological functionalities). So, it is argued that their preferences
  are already accounted for by the rational actor model employed in analytic thought experiments. This is not the case with my
  criticism since the rational actor model fails to capture the morally patient.<p>
<br>
<p>O3a: “Nozick does care about patients but excludes them for the sake of a simple yet powerful model.” This statement appears to
concede that his theory is incomplete. As I alluded to earlier, it is not unreasonable for him to assume that families and communities
would be compelled to be responsible in the absence of a nanny state, making them realize their full potential as moral creatures.
The thought goes that an extensive state that tries to fix every problem disincentivizes moral responsibility. A close real-world
example is the Kibbutz––left libertarian utopian communities in Israel––which makes the thought quite convincing. However, this
example shows that it is possible but not a guarantee. Humans, and even family, are capable of great evil and no one without the
capacity to fight it should be left to chance.<p>
<br>
	<p>O3b: “The model is salvageable since privatized PPS could arise in the minimal state.” This is the most powerful objection. It
  is possible that many kind people collectively realize that the cost of not having PPS is too high and a charismatic entrepreneur
  begins a non-profit PPS––a night-watchman for the ignored and abused––on behalf of patients that runs on various donations.
  This is the closest I have come to conceding to Nozick, to which I can only say that we have already discussed the shortcomings
  of charity and chance.<p>
<br>
	<p>O4: “Patients are entitled to or owed nothing more than they would have been as agents.” This is a controversial statement.
  Nozick could concede that it is a mistake to exclude patients, but that their inclusion would not change the calculus. It is
  possible that not only is O4 true, but that agents are owed more than patients. Here, the burden is on me to show that although
  patients and agents are not equal persons, a patient is not less of a person than an agent (just different).<p>
<br>
<p>My intuition states that I was born into a world I did not choose by people I did not know. I would have limited capacity to shape
that life for as long as I am a patient, which may be as long as I am forced to live. It is not clear to me why my entitlement to
the good life, or even “the decent life,” should be completely dependent on these facts. To be clear, I am not speaking of natural
assets, but the involuntary existence as one type of human in relation to another. Many schools of moral philosophy offer varying
answers to this debate. My impression is that there exists some hierarchy of rights that we consult when making moral decisions, and
for most cases but not all, the rights of an agent trumps that of a patient. Therefore, there exist some instances where a patient
should be prioritized over an agent depending on which rights are competing. So, there is at least one morally non-arbitrary reason
that overrides Nozick’s C2, making argument G partially or mostly true at best.<p>
<br>
<p>My conclusion depends heavily on my “intuition” and “impression,” things I cannot defend here without referring to specific schools
of moral philosophy e.g. contractualism (ones that Nozick likely rejects as a Kantian), turning this into a different paper.<p>
  <br>
<p>Conclusion<p>
  <br>
<p>In this paper, I have shown that Robert Nozick’s flavor of justice, consisting of a minimal state and historical entitlement theory
among other elements, is insufficient to protect the rights of moral patients such as children and the cognitively disabled. The root
of this issue is that he does not include them in his assumption of an individual person since he conflates persons and agents. This
possibly leaves patients vulnerable to neglect and abuse of physical and economic nature with little claims to formal justice. Next,
I examined five objections to this claim with two noteworthy findings in the last two. In the third objection, I found that although
his model is not fool-proof, it does allow for reasonable ways for patients to be protected. In the fourth objection, I found that
there is a seemingly irreconcilable issue of how to treat competing sets of rights, particularly when it is unclear of precisely what
comprises each set. The answer to the issue has deep implications on what it means to be a person. In summation, Nozickian justice is
as incomplete as any other theory of justice. It is worth putting competing theories to the same test for patients.</p>

<p> Comments by <a href="https://www.jonnythakkar.com/">Jonny Thakkar</a>: <p>
  <p>"...On the substantive issue itself, the big question is whether “patients” have rights or only interests—you might think we
  ought to promote their interests as a matter of utility maximization, but that they don’t have a right on the basis of which
  that maximization could be demanded of us, because they can’t be party to a social contract. If you went down that route the
  question would then be how to balance respecting rights and promoting utility; for Nozick rights serve as side constraints but
  don’t prevent the pursuit of utility maximization, so perhaps he could say that we should indeed promote the interests of
  patients, but not in ways that threaten the rights of agents—I suppose this is another way of stating your third objection."<p>
